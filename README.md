This command line application will help developers save more time to code by quickly creating readme files.

To install this application , you must install the necessary npm packages. 

Tools required for this application are the inquirer package and the fs package from npm.

To use this application you must initiate in your integrated terminal with the command "node index.js"
Then the user will be prompted with multiple questions and save their responses.
The saved answers are then inserted into a new readme file.

No contributions are being excepted at this time. As a new devolper, I will continue to adress issues in my current projects.
